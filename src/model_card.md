# Model Card

## Model Details
Random Forest Classifer with default parameters
## Intended Use
The model is designed to predict an individual's salary based on their personal and occupational attributes. The target attribute, salary, is binary, with two classes: less than or equal to 50K(<=50K) and greater than 50K(>50K).
## Training Data
The model was trained on the Census Income Dataset, which was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset provides a set of attributes, including age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours per week, and native country. The target attribute is salary, which is either less than or equal to 50K or greater than 50K.
## Evaluation Data
The model was evaluated on a test set which consisted of 20% of the total data.
## Metrics
The evaluation metrics used were Precision (0.74), Recall (0.60), and F1-Score (0.66).

## Ethical Considerations
It is important to note that the training data may contain biases, such as those in the hours per week attribute, which can be influenced by external factors. Additionally, not all countries are represented in the native country attribute, and the dataset may not be large enough to accurately represent the diversity of the target population.
## Caveats and Recommendations
This model is a simple Random Forest classifier with default parameters and has not been optimized for performance. 

For improved predictions, it is recommended to train a more sophisticated model or to use a larger, more diverse dataset.
